Question 2

There are n people in a line waiting to purchase tickets, with the 0th person at the front and the (n - 1)th person at the back. 

You are given a 0-indexed integer array of tickets of length n, where tickets[I] represents the number of tickets that the ith person wishes to purchase. 

Each person purchases a ticket in exactly one second. A person can only purchase one ticket at a time and must return to the end of the line (which happens instantly) to purchase additional tickets. If a person has no more tickets to buy, he or she will leave the line. 

Return the time spent for the individual atâ€¯position k (0-indexed) to finish buying tickets. 

Example:

Input: tickets = [2,3,2], k = 2
Output: 6
*/

const ticketCounter = (tickets, k)  => {
    let seconds = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < tickets.length; i++) {
        if (i <= k) {
            seconds += Math.min(tickets[k], tickets[i]);
        } else {
            seconds += Math.min(tickets[k] - 1, tickets [i]);
        }
    }
    return seconds;
}

console.log(ticketCounter([2,3,2], 2)); // expect 6
console.log(ticketCounter([4,2,3,2,4], 2)); // expect 12
